# Food-Recommender
Tasty Foods is an exclusive recommender system that recommends food based on similar food items as well as based on similar users.

# The problem Tasty Foods solves
Food is an essential need and a big platform to bring in revenue. It is a jackpot if one can recommend what sort of food they like. Recommenders help in increasing the income as they suggest a more relatable and suitable item from the list.

I have created a simple web app that showcases the recommender system.

# Challenges I ran into
- Firstly, I have never created a recommender system from scratch. I learnt it during the hackathon.
- Secondly, I had a bunch of errors while working with the data, especially the recommendation part and thankfully the scikit-learn documentation helped a lot.
